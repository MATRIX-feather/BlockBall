Teams
=====

There are 2 available Teams in BlockBall who play against each other. They are named blue and red per default and will also
be associated like that in the Chat UI and in this guide.

Of course it is possible to recolor them to something like yellow or pink, but all placeholders and the chat navigation will always stay like they are.

4. The Teams also provide so called `Textbook Settings <textbook.html>`_ which are Team specific messages.

You can find all options explained at the bottom of this page.

Configuring in your arena_x.yml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this stage, you should be able to find your arena save file. If not, please take a look at this `page <../general/database.html#editing-the-arena-files>`__.

1. Go to the **Open the arena_x.yml** of your arena
2. Search for the following section:

3. Customize the available options to your own needs.

It is recommend to use the ingame one-click armor creation instead of trying to understand the Itemstack format in the arena.yml.
